The correct answer is concise and unambiguous. The distractors are plausible concepts within RL but not the core differentiator. The Baseline question's correct answer is too verbose for a 'Nhớ' level question and essentially provides a definition rather than identifying the core difference. Its distractors are also less plausible as core differentiators."
