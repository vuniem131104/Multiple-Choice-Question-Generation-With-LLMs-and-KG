It directly tests the knowledge of MRP components by asking to identify a non-component, which requires understanding each component. The Pipeline question, however, only asks for the *number* of components, which is a less meaningful assessment of understanding the topic. Its distractors are just numbers, making them less pedagogically valuable. The Baseline's distractors are actual components, making the incorrect option (Tập hợp các hành động) a strong and relevant distractor."
