The Pipeline question focuses on the role of MDPs, while the Baseline question tests knowledge of core components. The Baseline question has slightly clearer wording, but the Pipeline question has slightly better alignment with Bloom's taxonomy. Distractors are plausible in both cases, and difficulty is appropriate for the 'Remember' level. Overall, the quality is very close, leading to a tie."
