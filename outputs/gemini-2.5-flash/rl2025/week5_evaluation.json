The Pipeline's correct answer is more of a 'Nhớ' (Recall) of the condition rather than the underlying reason."

The Pipeline question also addresses the topic but uses slightly more abstract language ('yếu tố tương tác nào thường được xác định là nguyên nhân chính') and its distractors are a bit less precise in pinpointing the exact combination of factors. The Baseline's distractors are also more directly related to the core concepts being tested."
