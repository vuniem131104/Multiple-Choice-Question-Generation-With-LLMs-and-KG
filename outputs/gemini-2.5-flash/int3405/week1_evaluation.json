The Baseline question is slightly better because its correct answer provides a more comprehensive definition of supervised learning, including the objective of predicting output for new data, which is a key aspect. Its distractors are also very well-formulated, representing common misconceptions or related but incorrect concepts (unsupervised, reinforcement, classification only, human supervision)."

It directly asks for the conditions under which Normal Equation is preferred over Gradient Descent, which is a core 'Evaluation' task based on dataset constraints. The Pipeline question is good but its correct answer 'Mini-batch Gradient Descent' is a specific variant of Gradient Descent, and the question doesn't explicitly ask for the *most* efficient variant, but rather the 'most suitable' method. The distractors in the Pipeline question are also less distinct in terms of the core choice between Gradient Descent (as a family) and Normal Equation. The Baseline question's distractors are very clear and directly address the trade-offs between the two main optimization methods."
