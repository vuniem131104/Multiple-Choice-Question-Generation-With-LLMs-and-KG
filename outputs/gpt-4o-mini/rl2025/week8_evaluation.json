The Pipeline question is a straightforward definition recall, while the Baseline question asks for a more detailed explanation, which is also appropriate for 'Understand'. Both have clear questions and plausible distractors. The Baseline's distractors are slightly better at representing common misconceptions, making it marginally stronger, but overall they are very close in quality."

Its distractors are clearly incorrect but plausible as common misunderstandings. The Pipeline question attempts to ask a more analytical question about comparing total regret and current action value, but its phrasing 'điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu tổng hối tiếc lớn hơn giá trị hành động hiện có?' is a bit awkward and the correct answer is more of an interpretation than a direct consequence. The comparison itself is not standard in how regret is typically analyzed. The distractors are also less precise.

It asks about 'yếu tố nào là quan trọng nhất để đánh giá hiệu suất của các chính sách hành động' when combining MAB and MDP. The correct answer 'Tỷ lệ chiến thắng của từng hành động trong môi trường quy trình quyết định' is too simplistic and not the primary metric for evaluating policies in MDPs (which typically involve expected cumulative reward or value functions).

The Pipeline question attempts to reach the 'Create' Bloom level by asking to design an algorithm. However, an MCQ format is generally not suitable for 'Create' level questions, as the 'correct answer' provided is a high-level description of components rather than a 'design'. The question itself is too open-ended for an MCQ, and the 'correct answer' is more of a summary of concepts than a specific design. The distractors are also not well-suited for an MCQ attempting to test 'creation'."
