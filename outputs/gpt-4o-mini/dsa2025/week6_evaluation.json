Its distractors are plausible misconceptions related to BST properties. The Baseline question's correct answer is incomplete, only stating that a BST has at most two children, which is true for any binary tree, not specifically a BST. Its distractors are also too obviously incorrect (e.g., 'danh sách liên kết', 'cấu trúc dữ liệu tuyến tính'), making the question too easy and less effective for assessment. The Pipeline question better tests the 'Nhớ' Bloom level by requiring a more detailed recall of the definition."

While O(h) is correct, O(log n) is also often used for balanced BSTs, and O(n) for skewed ones, making the question slightly ambiguous without further context on the 'type' of complexity being asked.
